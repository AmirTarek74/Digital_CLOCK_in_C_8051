# Digital_CLOCK_in_C_8051
In this project, we designed a digital clock that displays hours, minutes, and seconds on a  6X seven segments. It also incorporates real-time clock functionality with the ability to set the time using buttons:

1- start button : to start displaying the time.

2- set button : to stop the clock at that time.

3- shift button : to select desired segment you want to update.

4- increment button : to increment the selected segment by 1 at each pressing.
